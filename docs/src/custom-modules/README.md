# Custom Modules

If you build a custom module, consider contributing it! PRs are always welcome :)

Custom modules are located in the directory `~/.config/niji/modules`. Each module is a folder
in that directory; the name of the folder is the module name.

The heart of a niji module is a lua module in the module folder called `module.lua`.
It has this general structure:

```lua
local M = {}

function M.apply(config, theme)
    -- Apply the theme here
end

function M.reload(config)
    -- Reload the application here.
end

return M
```

The module defines two handlers, `apply` and `reload`.

The `apply` handler receives the [module config](#module-config) and the [theme](#theme) as parameters. It is responsible for
taking the theme, transforming its contents and writing them to where they need to go for the theming target to use them.

THe `reload` handler is optional. It is responsible for reloading the theming target to apply the new config. The reason why these
two are separate is so that niji can more easily tell which modules support live reloading, and so that users can selectively
disable live reloading for certain modules.

The exact semantics of the two handlers are different depending on the nature of the theming target, but in general, `apply` should
apply the theme and config in the least invasive way possible, while `reload` does whatever is necessary to live-reload the theming target.

## Module Config

The module config, which is passed as the first parameter to both the `apply` and the `reload` handlers, is a table with string keys

and arbitrary values. It comes from combining the module-specific configuration for your module with the global module configuration, both
of which are defined in `config.toml`. See [Configuration](../configuration.md) for more information.

Simple modules for personal use probably won't use this feature much, but it is recommended for modules that are used by multiple users
and may be merged to be builtin modules use the config feature to provide options to users, and respond to certain global configuration
options like `font_scale`.

## Theme

The theme is a table that corresponds directly to the theme format documented in [Custom Themes](../custom-themes.md).
All color values in the theme table are passed as a [`niji.Color`](./lua-api-reference.md#class-nijicolor) instance.

## Lua API

Niji provides its own Lua API for building modules. It is fully documented in the section [Lua API Reference](./lua-api-reference.md).

## Templates

A very common thing that modules need to do is inserting some values from the theme into a pre-made config file template.
niji provides a builtin system to do this, which is documented in the section [Templating Reference](./templating-reference.md),
and can be used via the [`niji.Template`](./lua-api-reference.md#class-nijitemplate) class from the Lua API.
